# Saeed Akbarshahi's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! I am [Your Full Name], a data scientist passionate about extracting insights from data and using machine learning to solve complex problems. With a background in [Your Background - e.g., Computer Science, Statistics, etc.], I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis, predictive modeling, and statistical inference. This portfolio showcases a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, and more.

## Portfolio Highlights

Here you will find projects ranging from exploratory data analysis to advanced machine learning models. Each project is contained in its own directory with a detailed README explaining the problem, approach, results, and insights.

- **Advancements in Water-Specific Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials**:

    Recent progress in computational chemistry has been significantly enhanced by machine learning (ML), especially in the development of potential-energy surfaces (PES). This advancement aims to narrow the gap between the high accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical force fields (FFs). The innovative approach of these ML techniques is to estimate potential energy directly from chemical structures without the need for fixed chemical bonds or a priori knowledge of interactions, instead leveraging the statistical relationships derived from training data. In this project, we focus on refining machine-learned interatomic potentials specifically for water, aiming to achieve a new level of precision and efficiency in modeling water's unique properties.

- **Enzyme Stability Prediction**:
  Understanding and accurately predict protein stability is a fundamental problem in biotechnology. Its applications include enzyme engineering for addressing the worldâ€™s challenges in sustainability, carbon neutrality and more. Improvements to enzyme stability could lower costs and increase the speed scientists can iterate on concepts. The goal of this project is to predict the thermostability of enzyme variants.
  
- **Economic Turbulence and Tech Giants: A Study of R&D and Operational Spending Impact on Profits**:
   "This project examines how spending on research and office costs affects the profits of big tech companies during the 2008 economic downturn and the COVID-19 crisis. It aims to reveal spending patterns during tough economic times.
